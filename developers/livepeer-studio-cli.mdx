The Livepeer Studio CLI is a command line tool that helps you generate a new Livepeer app in just a few seconds.

## Getting Started

First, create a Livepeer API key [here](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/developers/api-keys).

Next, use the CLI to generate a new project.

```sh
npx @livepeer/create
```

When prompted, enter your Livepeer __API key__ and __Stream ID__.

Once the app has been created, change into the new directory and run the start command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
